Getting Started
===============

To install:

1. Install the CoffeeScript compiler (1.5+ required)
2. Install compd
3. Run *./install*

All other dependencies, through the magic of virtualenv, are installed locally - in the *dep* directory as a matter of fact.

To run, use *./run*.

To develop, enter the virtualenv using *./shell*.

CoffeeScript frontend scripts can be recompiled with *./compile*.
Documentation will be generated if *pandoc* is available.

Credit

This implementation done through effective slave labour by Alistair Lynn.

With thanks to Rob Spanton, Scarzy, Sam Phippen, Edd Seabrook and Ben Clive for ideas and work on the previous iterations.
