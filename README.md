Getting Started
===============

To install:

1. Install the CoffeeScript compiler
2. Install compd
3. Run *./install*

All other dependencies, through the magic of virtualenv, are installed locally - in the *dep* directory as a matter of fact.

To run, use *./run*.

To develop, enter the virtualenv using *./shell*.

CoffeeScript frontend scripts can be recompiled with *./compile*.
